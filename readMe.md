**Assignment**

You are tasked with building a simple GraphQL API for a note-taking application.

Here's the spec for your project:

Users can create an account and log in. Each user can add, view, edit, and delete their notes. The notes should include a title, the note content, and timestamps for when the note was created and last modified.

1. **User Authentication**: Implement a simple JWT (JSON Web Tokens) based authentication system.
2. **CRUD Operations**: Users should be able to perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on their notes.
3. **Query Filtering**: Allow users to query notes based on the date or part of the note title.

**Bonus Tasks — not necessary but can increase chances of selection**

- Implement input validation and error handling in your GraphQL schema.
- Dockerize the application.
- Write basic unit tests for your resolvers to ensure they are functioning correctly.

Let us know if there are any areas that you require clarity, Thanks.

Good luck.
